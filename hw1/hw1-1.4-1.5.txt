HW 1.4

// CProgramButNotcpp.cpp
int main()
{
	int new = 0;
	return new;
}

THe above program will not compile in C++ since syntax 'new' is specific for C++ thus it can not be used as a variable name in C++. However, it will compile in C since C does not have 'new' as syntax.


HW 1.5

well .. I will venture a guess here .. the author named it C++ by putting "++" operator after C is because users first experience C++ think they are using C, but actually after experiencing it, users will think it is much better than C. If using ++C, by the definiton of forward "++" operator, it means it already surpasses C even before using it. (although both namings work fo me :P)
